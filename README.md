<h1> Hello! This is my exploration of Python in the beginning of 2021.</h1>
<p>
I started Angela Yu's Udemy course "100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021".
I am taking her assignments and projects and trying to add my own flavor to them here and there. I'll be adding comments to my code to show how I made the exercises or projects my own.

Here is a link to a specific type of calculator I made using Python: <a href="https://repl.it/@TimothyDHarris/RMD-Calculator#main.py" target="_blank">RMD Calculator</a>

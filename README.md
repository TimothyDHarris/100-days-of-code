<h1> Hello! This is part of my #100daysofcode challenge as I work to become a better programmer in 2021. </h1>
<p>
I am (1) following along on with Dr. Angela Yu on her Udemy course "100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021".
I am taking her assignments and projects and trying to add my own flavor to each of them. I'll be adding comments to my code to show how I made the exercises or projects my own.
I am also working on (2) applying the knowledge I've gained so far to build projects with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

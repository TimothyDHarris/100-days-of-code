# Below is my first attempt at coding for testing for a new year. However, my logic was not interconnected enough and the check was not roboust enough.
# if (year % 4 == 0):
#     print(f"The year {year} is a leap year.")
# elif (year % 100 != 0 and year % 400 == 0):
#     print(f"The year {year} is a leap year.")
# else:
#     print(f"The year {year} is not a leap year.")

# Teacher's solution below with some edits from me

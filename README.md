# Hello! This is my exploration of Python in the beginning of 2021.
I started Angela Yu's Udemy course "100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021".
I am taking her assignments and projects and trying to add my own flavor to them here and there. I'll be adding comments to my code to show how I made the exercises or projects my own.

Other Project (not from Angela's course).
Here is a link to a specific type of calculator I made using Python: [Calculator](https://repl.it/@TimothyDHarris/RMD-Calculator#main.py)

# Notes on Strings, Integers, Floats, and Booleans

# The number in the square brackets will determine what gets printed
# These are strings
print("Hello"[0])
print("Hello"[4])

# To declare an integer, just type out an integer (number)
# You can use underscores to better read large numbers and the computer will ignore them
# the plus sign works to add the intigers
print(123 + 456) 

# The Float type uses decimal points, like pi

# Boolean is only True or False
